In general, https://repo.palemoon.org/MoonchildProductions/UXP/src/branch/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md applies here too. Read that for more context and detail, but I will include my own interpretation and summary here.

## Our Goal with this Code of Conduct

To faciliate contribution to Epyrus from a broad audience of developers, and avoid alienating potential developers by tolerating discriminatory practices.

## Community of adults, language, and expected tolerance

Avoid cursing and rude language, deal with others respectfully and professionally. This is not a high school where you can impress your friends by being edgy, nor is it a tavern/bar sort of environment where you can let loose and speak your mind without considering others. In general, if you wouldn't say something in atypical white-collar office environment, or in a typical college classroom with the teacher present, you shouldn't say it here.

You may have to bear in mind that developers can be a bit "blunt" when discussing your mistakes or dismissing your concerns because they are not always the most tactful individuals, but this should never cross the line into harrassment or obviously intentional rudeness. Assume you are dealing with others in good faith unless there is a good reason to assume otherwise. 

English is the preferred language for issues and PRs, both because it is my native language, and the most popular second language globally (meaning that most contributors will speak it even if it's not their native tongue).

In general, try not to cause public controversy or drama in the community, and attempt to work differences out with others privately or privately contact an admin to mediate rather than making a scene. In other words, just don't rock the boat, and if someone else rocks the boat, try to stop the rocking. Keep things on an even keel.

## Responsibilities of the project's staff/leadership

Essentially, I (athenian200) am responsible for interpreting and applying this code of connect as it applies to Epyrus, this Git repo and the surrounding community, and as such I may issue warnings, bans, edit, or take any other action I deem necessary.

## Enforcing this Code of Conduct

Report any violations of this code in regards to Epyrus to athenian200@outlook.com and I will see what I can do about it.

## Confidentiality

I will be discreet and respect privacy of individuals who report issues to me, unless a situation arises where I might have to involve the police or lawyers, at which point things become more complicated and various legal/moral duties might take precedence over someone's privacy.
